## Course Details

- Course format: online
- Four (4) semester credits


## Course Description

This course will introduce you to statistical reasoning, which is a
framework for learning from data. We'll start with descriptive
statistics that allow us to summarize important features of data we've
collected without requiring much in the way of mathematical theory or
assumptions. Then we'll move on to probability and inference.

Probability gives us a language for talking about how random variability
arises in the data we collect. Inference uses the language of
probability to help us determine what we can learn from our data despite
the presence of that random variability.


## Prerequisites

There are no prior course requirements.


## Course Learning Objectives

After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

-   Identify and create appropriate visual and numerical summaries for
    different data types

-   Describe where an observation lies relative to a distribution (e.g.
    using standard units and/or percentile ranks)

-   Apply the normal approximation to data, and identify situations when
    this is or isn't appropriate

-   Calculate chances of events using basic laws of probability

-   Understand what the sampling distribution (probability histogram) of
    a statistic is

-   Carry out and interpret standard statistical inference techniques
    including correlation, regression, plug-in estimation, confidence
    intervals, and hypothesis testing

-   Explain the relationship between the sampling distribution and the
    precision of standard statistical inference techniques

-   Evaluate and critique reported statistical results in the real world

While the instructor will interact with the whole class and will oversee
all activities and grading, as well as being available to resolve any
issues that may arise, the GSIs will be your main point of contact. Your
GSIs are responsible for assisting you directly with questions about
assignments and course requirements. The GSIs will also facilitate
ongoing discussion and interaction with you on major topics in each
module.


### GSI Office Hours

The GSIs will offer office hours in person or via Zoom. These office
hours allow for synchronous interaction with the GSIs and are a good
opportunity to discuss your questions relevant to the course. You may
attend any office hours, not only those for your assigned GSI and
instructor. Times and links to the appropriate Zoom meeting will be
available in bCourses. See bCourses for the time and place.


### Question & Answer Sessions

The instructor will hold in person Q&A sessions to address any questions
you have on the homework and other course related questions. See
bCourses for the time and place.

### Course Mail

Please contact your instructor and GSI using your Berkeley email (not
through bCourses).

### Course Help

You're not alone in this course; the instructor and GSIs are here to
support you as you learn the material. It\'s expected that some aspects
of this course will take time to grasp, and the best way to grasp
challenging material is to ask questions.

We will be using Ed Discussion as our discussion forum. A link to ED is
on bCourses. You can also reach out to the course staff in office hours,
Q&A sessions, lab sections, and/or via email.

If you need to contact the instructor through email, please ensure to
also include your assigned GSI in the thread, unless you need to discuss
a personal matter.

### Students with Disabilities

If you require course accommodations due to a physical, emotional, or
learning disability, contact [UC Berkeley\'s Disabled Students\'
Program (DSP)](http://dsp.berkeley.edu/). Notify the instructor and GSI through
course email of the accommodations you would like to use. You must have a
Letter of Accommodation on file with UC Berkeley to have accommodations made in
the course.

UC Berkeley is committed to providing robust educational experiences for
all learners. With this goal in mind, we have enabled the ALLY tool for
this course. You can now automatically generate "Alternative Formats"
for course files and bCourses Pages. Depending on the context, these
formats can include Tagged PDF, HTML, BeeLine Reader, Electronic
Braille, ePub, [ImmersiveÂ  Reader](https://youtu.be/xFWvTK2veoc), MP3, and translated versions.
For more information, watch the video entitled, "[Ally Tutorial](https://youtu.be/rFqNhI-XSVk)".


## Course Materials and Technical Requirements

### Textbook / Required Materials

The required textbook is Statistics: Fourth Edition by Freedman, Pisani,
and Purves. The paperback version of the fourth edition is fine and
usually much cheaper, as is the international version. You will find the
assigned readings posted on bCourses.

### Technical Requirements

This course is built on a Learning Management System (LMS) called Canvas
(UC Berkeley's instance of Canvas is called bCourses). You'll need to
meet these [computer specifications to participate within this online
platform](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-the-browser-and-computer-requirements-for-Canvas/ta-p/66).

You will also need a calculator or calculator app that can raise numbers
to a power and do square roots. Statistical or graphing calculators are
not necessary.

#### Technical Support


If you're having technical difficulties, please alert one of the GSIs
immediately. However, understand that neither the GSIs, nor the
instructor can assist you with technical problems. You must call or
email tech support to resolve any technical issues.

To contact tech support, click on the \"Help\" button on the bottom left
of the global navigation menu in bCourses. Be sure to document all
interactions (save emails and transaction numbers).


## Learning Activities and Assignments

You're expected to fully participate in all the course activities
described below. A weekly course schedule is provided on the Syllabus
page in bCourses. Check bCourses for specific assignment due dates.

### Asynchronous/Synchronous Format

Some of your learning activities will be asynchronous (i.e., lectures,
readings, assignments), which you can complete at any time before the
due date. Other activities will be synchronous (i.e., lab sections,
office hours, Q&A sessions, final exam, etc.), which you will attend at
a specific time.

All times listed are Pacific Time---please adjust for your time zone. If
you prefer, you can [set your own time zone](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-set-a-time-zone-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/414) to display throughout
bCourses.

### Modules and Parts

This course is organized into Modules, each of which is further divided
into Parts. You can think of a Part as being equivalent to the material
covered in a traditional in-person lecture. Each Part has other learning
activities associated with it. As you move through the course materials
online, you are expected to fully participate in all the course
activities described below.

### Reading Assignments and Suggested Practice Problems

Most Parts have a reading assignment and suggested practice problems
from the textbook. You may prefer to do these either before or after
watching the lecture videos. The answers to the suggested practice
problems are in the back of the textbook. They are for your practice
only and are not graded.

### Lecture Videos and Discussion Forums

Each Part has lecture videos for you to watch. All lectures have been
pre-recorded, for you to watch on your own: *there are no live lecture
meetings for this course*. Recorded lectures support your readings and
assignments but also contain additional material that may be included in
the exams. You're expected to take notes while viewing the lectures as
you would in a regular classroom. **Please watch the lectures for each
Part before the following day's lab section**, as indicated in the
schedule on the Syllabus page in bCourses.


The slides for the lecture videos are also posted. I suggest you
download the slides and use them to follow along and add your own notes
while watching the videos. Post your comments and questions on ED and
the instructor/GSIs will respond.

### Comprehension Quizzes (10%)

Each Part has a short quiz associated with it, to be completed after
watching the lecture videos. Quizzes are due by 11:59 pm Pacific Time on
the days indicated in the schedule. **It's important to keep up with the
lecture videos and quizzes so that you're ready to participate in labs
on the scheduled dates.**

### Labs/Section Participation (20%)

Labs allow you to practice what you are learning by working on problems
in a collaborative environment. There are two ways to participate in
labs. You may either attend synchronously in person, or you may complete
the lab problems on your own and upload a copy of your work and
solutions. If you choose to complete the lab on your own, it is strongly
recommended that you check your answers against the solutions (posted to
bCourses the following day) and bring any questions to o[ï¬]{.s7}ce
hours.

Labs are graded based on participation, with 0-2 points awarded for each
lab. If you attend your lab and participate according to the guidelines
your GSI describes, you will automatically get full credit. If you do
the lab problems on your own, you will get credit based on the
percentage of lab problems you have made a good-faith effort to
complete, with 2 points for attempting everything, 1 point for
attempting at least half the problems, and 0 points otherwise. You
should upload your work by **11:59PM PST** on the day of the lab.

Your lab section number will be the one in which you enrolled. You can
view this section number by exploring the \"Section\" column within the
\"People\" page.

### Homework Assignments (30%)

There are 5 assignments. We use the [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)
platform for submitting and grading assignments. You can log in directly from
the Gradescope link in bCourses left navigation. Further details and
instructions about uploading your assignments are included on bCourses.
Assignments are due at **11:59PM PST** on the dates indicated in the course
schedule (see the Syllabus page in bCourses). Because of the size of the class
we cannot accept late assignments. Instead we allow all students to drop one
assignment for emergencies.

### Mastery Quizzes (25%)

Mastery quizzes are designed to evaluate and reinforce mastery of key
skills and are held in place of midterm exams. They are held on
bCourses, have a default time limit of 50 minutes, and consist of
multiple-choice questions. These quizzes are open book, open notes, but
working with other students is prohibited. Quiz problems are also
randomized to deter cheating. You should finish the Mastery quizzes by
**11:59PM PST** on the dates indicated in the course schedule (see the
Syllabus page in bCourses).

### Final Exam (15%)

The final exam will be held online (on bCourses) on **December 19, 2024,
11:30--2:30pm**. If you have a conflict with this time, please inform
your instructors **at least one month in advance** to arrange an
alternative time to take the exam. The final will have a similar format
to the Mastery Quizzes, but it will be cumulative---covering material
from the entire course---and with more questions.


## Grading

Your final course grade will be calculated as follows:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Category              | Percentage of Grade   | Notes                 |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+

|                       |                       | lowest 1 assignment   |
|                       |                       | scores will be        |
|                       |                       | dropped.              |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

|                       |                       | necessary.            |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Final Exam            | 15%                   | N/A                   |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
: Table 1: Final Grade Percentages


Course letter grades will be assigned based on the following intervals:


| Letter Grade | Percentage Interval
|--------------| ---------------------
| A+/A/A-      | 100-90%
| B+/B/B-      | 90-80%
| C+/C/C-      | 80-60%
| F            | Below 60%
: Table 2: Grade Intervals

If you are taking the class pass-fail, the cutoff for passing is 60%.
The bCourses grade book uses the grading scheme above, so you can always
check your current course grade there. **We do not round up when
calculating letter grades, even when the score is very close.** This is
because grades tend to have a continuous distribution, so that no matter
where we set the threshold, there are always going to be students who
just miss it.


## Strategies for Successful Learning

### Take Care of Yourself

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and taking time to recharge your
mental health. Taking time to care for yourself, and avoiding burnout,
will help you achieve your academic, professional, and personal goals.

If you start to feel overwhelmed, be kind to yourself and reach out for
support. Remember that seeking help is a courageous thing to do---for
yourself and for those who care about you.

[Support
Resources](https://evcp.berkeley.edu/programs-resources/academic-accommodations-hub/support-resources)
include emotional, physical, safety, social, and other basic wellbeing
resources for students. Academic resources can be found at the [Student
Learning Center](https://slc.berkeley.edu/home) and [English Language
Resource](https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/families/english_resources)
sites. Berkeley's Office of Emergency Management has resources to [prepare for
emergencies](https://oem.berkeley.edu/get-prepared).


## Course Policies

### Late Work Policy

**Comprehension quizzes and labs and assignments are not accepted for credit
late**, but we automatically drop the **lowest 5** comprehension quizzes and
labs and **lowest 1** assignment when calculating your course grade. This is
meant to cover a variety of issues that can arise, including technical issues,
illness, work conflicts, family concerns, etc. This adjustment is already built
into the bCourses gradebook. If you add the course late and miss the first
assignment deadline you will need to use your 1 assignment drop on that
assignment.

DSP students whose accommodations include extensions on assignments will
automatically receive a 48-hour extension on assignments on Gradescope.
If you don't see this set up for you please contact the instructor.

### Scheduling Conflicts

Please notify the instructor in writing by the second week of the term
about any known or potential academic or extracurricular conflicts. I
will try my best to help you with making accommodations but cannot
promise them in all cases.

### Academic Integrity

Any assignment or exam submitted by you is presumed to be your own
original work. While you are encouraged to study together and to work
together on the lab problems and assignments, there is no value to you
in copying someone else's work. The standard for what constitutes your
"own original work" is that if asked, you should be able to convincingly
explain out loud what you have written to the instructor or a GSI. As
you work on assignments, you can talk to each other about the problems,
but you need to get to the point where the answer is something you have
internalized as something you, yourself, understand well enough to
convincingly explain to someone else. In cases where cheating is
suspected, the instructor or GSI may ask you to make this verbal
explanation.

To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference
is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and
usually further disciplinary action. If you're unclear about the
expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or
examination, be sure to seek clarification from your instructor or GSI
beforehand. For additional information, read these UC Berkeley Library
guides on [How to Avoid Plagiarism](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=1224972&p=8961642) and [Statistics: Writing + Citing](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=118174&p=769338)
(the latter includes some recommended citation management tools).


As a member of the campus community, you're expected to demonstrate
integrity in all of your academic endeavors and will be evaluated on
your own merits. The consequences of cheating and academic
dishonesty---including a formal discipline file, possible loss of future
internship, scholarship, or employment opportunities, and denial of
admission to graduate school---are simply not worth it. Read more about
[Berkeley's Honor Code](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code).

### Incomplete Course Grade

Students who have substantially completed the course but for serious
extenuating circumstances, are unable to complete the remaining course
activities, may request an Incomplete grade. This request must be
submitted in writing to the GSI and instructor. You must provide
verifiable documentation for the seriousness of the extenuating
circumstances.

Refer to the Office of the Registrar\'s website for more information on
the university\'s policy on [Incomplete Grades](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/faculty-staff/grading/incomplete-grades).


## End of Course Evaluation

UC Berkeley is committed to improving our online courses and
instruction. Before your course ends, please take a few minutes to
participate in the course evaluation. We are interested in your online
learning experience, and your feedback will help us plan for the future
and make improvements. The evaluation does not request any personal
information, and your responses will remain strictly confidential.
Information about the course evaluation will be made available in
bCourses.
