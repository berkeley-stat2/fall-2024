We’ll start with descriptive statistics that allow us to summarize important features of data we’ve collected without requiring much in the way of mathematical theory or assumptions. Then we’ll move on to probability and inference.\nProbability gives us a language for talking about how random variability arises in the data we collect. Inference uses the language of probability to help us determine what we can learn from our data despite the presence of that random variability.",

    "text": "Course Learning Objectives\nAfter successfully completing this course, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify and create appropriate visual and numerical summaries for different data types\nDescribe where an observation lies relative to a distribution (e.g. using standard units and/or percentile ranks)\nApply the normal approximation to data, and identify situations when this is or isn’t appropriate\nCalculate chances of events using basic laws of probability\nUnderstand what the sampling distribution (probability histogram) of a statistic is\nCarry out and interpret standard statistical inference techniques including correlation, regression, plug-in estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing\nExplain the relationship between the sampling distribution and the precision of standard statistical inference techniques\nEvaluate and critique reported statistical results in the real world\n\n\nInstructor Information and Communication\n\nCourse Instructor\n\nAdam Lucas\n\n\n\nGraduate Student Instructors (GSIs)\n\nIsabel Moreno: (labs 105,106)\nFrederik Stihler: (labs 101,103)\nLauren Murai: (labs 102,104)\nJasmine Khamuani (labs 107,110)\nYimeng Yin (labs 108,109)\nAustin Tao (labs 111,117)\nCancan Jin (labs 112, 113)\nMinh Le (labs 114, 116)\nYichen Xu (labs 115, 118)\n\nWhile the instructor will interact with the whole class and will oversee all activities and grading, as well as being available to resolve any issues that may arise, the GSIs will be your main point of contact. Your GSIs are responsible for assisting you directly with questions about assignments and course requirements. The GSIs will also facilitate ongoing discussion and interaction with you on major topics in each module.\n\n\n\nGSI Office Hours\nThe GSIs will offer office hours in person or via Zoom. These office hours allow for synchronous interaction with the GSIs and are a good opportunity to discuss your questions relevant to the course. You may attend any office hours, not only those for your assigned GSI and instructor. Times and links to the appropriate Zoom meeting will be available in bCourses. See bCourses for the time and place.\n\n\nQuestion & Answer Sessions\nThe instructor will hold in person Q&A sessions to address any questions you have on the homework and other course related questions. See bCourses for the time and place.\n\n\nCourse Mail\nPlease contact your instructor and GSI using your Berkeley email (not through bCourses).\n\n\nCourse Help\nYou’re not alone in this course; the instructor and GSIs are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of this course will take time to grasp, and the best way to grasp challenging material is to ask questions.\nWe will be using Ed Discussion as our discussion forum. A link to ED is on bCourses. You can also reach out to the course staff in office hours, Q&A sessions, lab sections, and/or via email.\nIf you need to contact the instructor through email, please ensure to also include your assigned GSI in the thread, unless you need to discuss a personal matter.\n\n\nStudents with Disabilities\nIf you require course accommodations due to a physical, emotional, or learning disability, contact UC Berkeley's Disabled Students' Program (DSP). Notify the instructor and GSI through course email of the accommodations you would like to use. You must have a Letter of Accommodation on file with UC Berkeley to have accommodations made in the course.\nUC Berkeley is committed to providing robust educational experiences for all learners. With this goal in mind, we have enabled the ALLY tool for this course. You can now automatically generate “Alternative Formats” for course files and bCourses Pages. Depending on the context, these formats can include Tagged PDF, HTML, BeeLine Reader, Electronic Braille, ePub, Immersive  Reader, MP3, and translated versions. For more information, watch the video entitled, “Ally Tutorial”.",

The paperback version of the fourth edition is fine and usually much cheaper, as is the international version. You will find the assigned readings posted on bCourses.\n\n\nTechnical Requirements\nThis course is built on a Learning Management System (LMS) called Canvas (UC Berkeley’s instance of Canvas is called bCourses). You’ll need to meet these computer specifications to participate within this online platform.\nYou will also need a calculator or calculator app that can raise numbers to a power and do square roots. Statistical or graphing calculators are not necessary.\n\nTechnical Support\nIf you’re having technical difficulties, please alert one of the GSIs immediately. However, understand that neither the GSIs, nor the instructor can assist you with technical problems. You must call or email tech support to resolve any technical issues.\nTo contact tech support, click on the \"Help\" button on the bottom left of the global navigation menu in bCourses.

    "section": "Learning Activities and Assignments",
    "text": "Learning Activities and Assignments\nYou’re expected to fully participate in all the course activities described below. A weekly course schedule is provided on the Syllabus page in bCourses. Check bCourses for specific assignment due dates.\n\nAsynchronous/Synchronous Format\nSome of your learning activities will be asynchronous (i.e., lectures, readings, assignments), which you can complete at any time before the due date. Other activities will be synchronous (i.e., lab sections, office hours, Q&A sessions, final exam, etc.), which you will attend at a specific time.\nAll times listed are Pacific Time—please adjust for your time zone. If you prefer, you can set your own time zone to display throughout bCourses.\n\n\nModules and Parts\nThis course is organized into Modules, each of which is further divided into Parts. You can think of a Part as being equivalent to the material covered in a traditional in-person lecture. Each Part has other learning activities associated with it. As you move through the course materials online, you are expected to fully participate in all the course activities described below.\n\n\nReading Assignments and Suggested Practice Problems\nMost Parts have a reading assignment and suggested practice problems from the textbook. You may prefer to do these either before or after watching the lecture videos. The answers to the suggested practice problems are in the back of the textbook. They are for your practice only and are not graded.\n\n\nLecture Videos and Discussion Forums\nEach Part has lecture videos for you to watch. All lectures have been pre-recorded, for you to watch on your own: there are no live lecture meetings for this course. Recorded lectures support your readings and assignments but also contain additional material that may be included in the exams. You’re expected to take notes while viewing the lectures as you would in a regular classroom. Please watch the lectures for each Part before the following day’s lab section, as indicated in the schedule on the Syllabus page in bCourses.\nThe slides for the lecture videos are also posted. I suggest you download the slides and use them to follow along and add your own notes while watching the videos. Post your comments and questions on ED and the instructor/GSIs will respond.\n\n\nComprehension Quizzes (10%)\nEach Part has a short quiz associated with it, to be completed after watching the lecture videos. Quizzes are due by 11:59 pm Pacific Time on the days indicated in the schedule. It’s important to keep up with the lecture videos and quizzes so that you’re ready to participate in labs on the scheduled dates.\n\n\nLabs/Section Participation (20%)\nLabs allow you to practice what you are learning by working on problems in a collaborative environment. There are two ways to participate in labs. You may either attend synchronously in person, or you may complete the lab problems on your own and upload a copy of your work and solutions. If you choose to complete the lab on your own, it is strongly recommended that you check your answers against the solutions (posted to bCourses the following day) and bring any questions to oﬃce hours.\nLabs are graded based on participation, with 0-2 points awarded for each lab. If you attend your lab and participate according to the guidelines your GSI describes, you will automatically get full credit. If you do the lab problems on your own, you will get credit based on the percentage of lab problems you have made a good-faith effort to complete, with 2 points for attempting everything, 1 point for attempting at least half the problems, and 0 points otherwise. You should upload your work by 11:59PM PST on the day of the lab.\nYour lab section number will be the one in which you enrolled. You can view this section number by exploring the \"Section\" column within the \"People\" page.\n\n\nHomework Assignments (30%)\nThere are 5 assignments. We use the Gradescope platform for submitting and grading assignments. You can log in directly from the Gradescope link in bCourses left navigation. Further details and instructions about uploading your assignments are included on bCourses. Assignments are due at 11:59PM PST on the dates indicated in the course schedule (see the Syllabus page in bCourses). Because of the size of the class we cannot accept late assignments. Instead we allow all students to drop one assignment for emergencies.\n\n\nMastery Quizzes (25%)\nMastery quizzes are designed to evaluate and reinforce mastery of key skills and are held in place of midterm exams. They are held on bCourses, have a default time limit of 50 minutes, and consist of multiple-choice questions. These quizzes are open book, open notes, but working with other students is prohibited. Quiz problems are also randomized to deter cheating. You should finish the Mastery quizzes by 11:59PM PST on the dates indicated in the course schedule (see the Syllabus page in bCourses).\n\n\nFinal Exam (15%)\nThe final exam will be held online (on bCourses) on December 19, 2024, 11:30–2:30pm. If you have a conflict with this time, please inform your instructors at least one month in advance to arrange an alternative time to take the exam. The final will have a similar format to the Mastery Quizzes, but it will be cumulative—covering material from the entire course—and with more questions.",

The bCourses grade book uses the grading scheme above, so you can always check your current course grade there. We do not round up when calculating letter grades, even when the score is very close. This is because grades tend to have a continuous distribution, so that no matter where we set the threshold, there are always going to be students who just miss it.",

    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nLate Work Policy\nComprehension quizzes and labs and assignments are not accepted for credit late, but we automatically drop the lowest 5 comprehension quizzes and labs and lowest 1 assignment when calculating your course grade. This is meant to cover a variety of issues that can arise, including technical issues, illness, work conflicts, family concerns, etc. This adjustment is already built into the bCourses gradebook. If you add the course late and miss the first assignment deadline you will need to use your 1 assignment drop on that assignment.\nDSP students whose accommodations include extensions on assignments will automatically receive a 48-hour extension on assignments on Gradescope. If you don’t see this set up for you please contact the instructor.\n\n\nScheduling Conflicts\nPlease notify the instructor in writing by the second week of the term about any known or potential academic or extracurricular conflicts. I will try my best to help you with making accommodations but cannot promise them in all cases.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAny assignment or exam submitted by you is presumed to be your own original work. While you are encouraged to study together and to work together on the lab problems and assignments, there is no value to you in copying someone else’s work. The standard for what constitutes your “own original work” is that if asked, you should be able to convincingly explain out loud what you have written to the instructor or a GSI. As you work on assignments, you can talk to each other about the problems, but you need to get to the point where the answer is something you have internalized as something you, yourself, understand well enough to convincingly explain to someone else. In cases where cheating is suspected, the instructor or GSI may ask you to make this verbal explanation.\nTo copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. If you’re unclear about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or examination, be sure to seek clarification from your instructor or GSI beforehand. For additional information, read these UC Berkeley Library guides on How to Avoid Plagiarism and Statistics: Writing + Citing (the latter includes some recommended citation management tools).\nAs a member of the campus community, you’re expected to demonstrate integrity in all of your academic endeavors and will be evaluated on your own merits. The consequences of cheating and academic dishonesty—including a formal discipline file, possible loss of future internship, scholarship, or employment opportunities, and denial of admission to graduate school—are simply not worth it. Read more about Berkeley’s Honor Code.\n\n\nIncomplete Course Grade\nStudents who have substantially completed the course but for serious extenuating circumstances, are unable to complete the remaining course activities, may request an Incomplete grade. This request must be submitted in writing to the GSI and instructor. You must provide verifiable documentation for the seriousness of the extenuating circumstances.\nRefer to the Office of the Registrar's website for more information on the university's policy on Incomplete Grades.",
